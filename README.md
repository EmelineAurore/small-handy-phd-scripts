## Randomize sample names for a PCR 
I often randomize samples on a PCR plate to avoid potential batch issues.

Use [this script](small-handy-phd-scripts/randomizing-sample-location-on-pcr-plate.R) to produces a small CSV file (such as [this output example](small-handy-phd-scripts/test2.csv)) that you can bring to the lab.

You will need to provide a list of sample names in a CSV, such as [this input example](small-handy-phd-scripts/my_list_of_sample_names.csv).
